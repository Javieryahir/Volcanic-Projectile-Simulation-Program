# Volcanic-Projectile-Simulation-Program
This project involves developing a 2D simulation to model the trajectories of volcanic projectiles for a game environment. The simulation will demonstrate the flight paths of three particles launched simultaneously from a volcano, with the option for users to adjust key variables such as air resistance, initial velocity, and launch angle.

The system will feature realistic data, reflecting researched values like particle mass, air density, and eruption dynamics. Throughout the simulation, the program will display real-time updates of the projectiles' speed, position, maximum height, and final impact point. The final report will include analyses of the maximum height reached by the particles, their horizontal distance, and the velocity at which they would strike rescuers, in both meters per second and kilometers per hour.

The final output will provide the design team with accurate visualizations and insights into how these factors impact projectile motion, enhancing the realism of the game experience.
